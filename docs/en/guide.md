# DiceFrame User Guide

[中文](../zh/guide.md) | English

Whether you are a GM preparing a new adventure or a player joining the table, this is the place to start. The sections below cover everyday tasks—from creating a game, taking actions, and rolling dice to using chat bots and updating DiceFrame. For code and development details, see the relevant technical guides.

## First Launch

Start the WebUI and open the address printed in the terminal, normally:

```text
http://localhost:18000
```

On the first visit, open Settings and enter:

- API URL for an OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions service.
- Model name, for example `deepseek-v4-pro`.
- API key from that service.

Save the settings and use Test connection to verify that the model can respond.

If you open Create before finishing the model settings, a notice at the top links directly to Settings. You can still fill in the world and characters first; complete the setup before generating content or starting the adventure.

### Long-term memory (vector memory) configuration (optional)

DiceFrame stores confirmed plot points as long-term memory and recalls them when generating new content. By default it uses keyword matching; enabling vector memory switches to semantic recall, which helps for long campaigns or information-heavy plots. Vector memory is **not required** — the game works fine without it.

Configure via `data/config.json` (or environment variables):

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `embedding_enabled` | Enables vector memory | `false` |
| `embedding_base_url` | Embedding service URL (OpenAI-compatible `/v1` or Ollama) | empty |
| `embedding_model` | Embedding model name | `nomic-embed-text` |
| `embedding_api_key` | Service key; leave empty for local services | empty |

Environment variables: `TRPG_EMBEDDING_MODEL`, `TRPG_EMBEDDING_API_KEY` (`embedding_enabled` and `embedding_base_url` live in `data/config.json`). Secrets should go into the `embedding_api_key` field of `data/secrets.json` rather than plain config.

**Option 1: local deployment (recommended, also the default model)**

Run an embedding model locally with [Ollama](https://ollama.com). Nothing leaves your machine and no service key is needed:

```powershell
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

Then configure DiceFrame:

```json
{ "embedding_enabled": true, "embedding_base_url": "http://127.0.0.1:11434", "embedding_model": "nomic-embed-text" }
```

Ollama listens on port `11434` by default and DiceFrame uses its native endpoint; leave the API key empty. For better Chinese support you can also use `bge-m3` (`ollama pull bge-m3`, longer context).

**Option 2: online service (alternative)**

With network access and a service key, any OpenAI-compatible online embedding service works, for example SiliconFlow. This is only a configuration example — DiceFrame has no partnership with or sponsorship from that provider:

```json
{ "embedding_enabled": true, "embedding_base_url": "https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1", "embedding_model": "BAAI/bge-m3", "embedding_api_key": "your key" }
```

After saving you can test the connection in Settings; failures are logged and long-term memory falls back to keyword matching, so normal play is unaffected.

## Optional text-to-speech

Speech is not required to play. For a first test, open Settings → Advanced → Text-to-speech and keep Browser / system voice selected. Enable automatic GM narration only if you want it, then save. This mode downloads no model; the available voices come from the current browser and operating system.

For a more natural local voice, DiceFrame handles connection and playback while a separate application such as Kokoro or GPT-SoVITS generates the audio. Installing a voice preset does not download a multi-gigabyte model and does not start a TTS server in the background.

### Easiest local option: Kokoro

If Docker Desktop is already installed, start the open-source Kokoro-FastAPI CPU service:

```powershell
docker run --name diceframe-kokoro -p 8880:8880 ghcr.io/remsky/kokoro-fastapi-cpu:v0.6.0
```

The first run downloads the image and model. Leave that terminal running, then configure DiceFrame:

1. Open Settings → Advanced → Text-to-speech.
2. Select OpenAI compatible.
3. Set `Base URL` to `http://127.0.0.1:8880/v1`.
4. Leave `API Key` empty, set the model to `kokoro`, and choose `MP3`.
5. Install and enable **Kokoro Chinese Voice Presets** from the plugin store or Local Install. The preset is optional: you can instead add a personal OpenAI-compatible voice with an existing ID such as `zf_xiaobei`.
6. Choose the default, GM, and player voices under Role voice mapping, then select Save and test.
7. Once preview works, optionally enable automatic narration. Public narration can still be played manually from the Play page when automatic speech is off.

When DiceFrame itself runs in Docker, `127.0.0.1` refers to the DiceFrame container rather than the Windows host. Use `http://host.docker.internal:8880/v1` in the common desktop setup, or the TTS service name when both containers share a network.

### GPT-SoVITS

Start the GPT-SoVITS HTTP API using its own instructions, then select GPT-SoVITS and enter its service URL. Each personal voice also needs a reference WAV, an exact transcript, and the prompt language:

- Upload the WAV when DiceFrame and the TTS service can read the same local file.
- For another computer or container, use Server-visible path. The path must be readable from the TTS service itself.

### Troubleshooting

- Connection failed: open Kokoro's `http://127.0.0.1:8880/docs` first, then check that the DiceFrame Base URL ends in `/v1`.
- Voice not found: enable the installed preset, or verify that the voice ID exists in the active TTS server.
- Browser speech works but local speech fails: this is normally a server, port, or container-network issue. Switching back to Browser voice does not affect saves.
- A remote TTS service receives the public narration that it is asked to speak. Prefer a local service for private sessions, and never expose the admin UI or local TTS port directly to the public internet.

## Start a Game

1. Open Create.
2. Choose the game language.
3. Select a world template, generate one with AI, or enter your own setting.
4. Choose the rules and difficulty.
5. Create a character, or generate a draft and edit it.
6. Enter Play.
7. Submit an action such as “I inspect the runes on the wall.”

DiceFrame sends the action to the GM model, parses narrative state tags, and records changes to HP, inventory, gold, experience, scene, and related state.

## Languages and Content

Interface language changes WebUI text. Game language is stored in the save and controls GM narration, opening scenes, summaries, quick actions, and AI-generated content.

World templates, lorebooks, and content packs have their own `language`. Create prioritizes matching content but still shows other languages. Selecting Chinese content in an English UI does not translate the content, and vice versa.

Rules use `<rule_id>.json` for Chinese and `<rule_id>_en.json` for English. The game loads the matching language and falls back to Chinese when an English file is absent.

## Turns and Actions

Solo games progress after one action is submitted.

In multiplayer, each active player may submit one action per round. DiceFrame advances when every active player has submitted, or when the GM manually forces progression. There is no timeout: a slow or disconnected player remains in the waiting list until the GM decides. A player may revise the current action within the configured limit; only the final version is sent to the GM model.

## Multiplayer

The GM creates a game and sends the invite link. Players can:

- Join the current game.
- Create a character.
- Claim an existing character.
- Submit actions from their own player page.

The GM can view player status. Mark a temporarily absent player Away; that player follows the party without initiating major decisions and no longer blocks the round. Restore the player when they return.

## Dice Flow

Some actions resolve directly; others require a check. Players describe actions naturally and never need to type “check” or click a roll button. After the action batch closes, a separate GM adjudication phase reads every action and calls `dice_checks` with existing players, attributes/skills, and targets. The server rolls exactly once and the narration phase must follow that fixed result:

1. A player submits an action.
2. A solo action advances immediately; multiplayer advances when everyone acts or the GM forces it.
3. The adjudication phase decides which actions warrant checks.
4. The server rolls once and shows reveal cards in action order.
5. The GM narrates from those immutable results.

CoC failures that can spend Luck still pause for the owning player or GM to decide. That decision never rerolls the die.

## Reading State Changes

After GM narration, the State changes panel shows what was actually committed to the save:

- HP damage or healing.
- Items gained, lost, or consumed.
- Gold gained, paid, or deducted.
- Experience and level changes.
- Scene or situation changes.
- Character-private perceptions.

If prose and recorded state conflict, the recorded state is authoritative.

### Confirming a Purchase

When the story offers something that costs money, DiceFrame asks the paying player to confirm first. No money is deducted and no item is added before confirmation.

In multiplayer, the player who is paying confirms the purchase. The purchase completes only when that character has enough money; rejecting it or having insufficient funds leaves both the balance and inventory unchanged.

## Chat Bot

DiceFrame can connect a Web game to QQ group chat through the built-in QQ/NapCat plugin. The adapter uses HTTP APIs and does not read saves directly.

1. Open plugin settings in the WebUI.
2. Enter the NapCat WebSocket address, port, and token.
3. Enable QQ / NapCat.
4. Copy the Bot binding command from the game page.
5. Send it to the target group.

The built-in plugin receives its DiceFrame Bot API Token automatically. For an external bridge such as MaiBot, copy the DiceFrame URL and token from Settings → Bot API into that bridge. Regenerating the token invalidates the old value.

The Bot follows the current game's language for help, status, recap, map, payment, character-creation, and error messages. The examples below use the English commands; Chinese games retain the corresponding Chinese commands.

## Using the Plugin Store

Open Settings → Plugins → Plugin Store. The store is an index: authors retain their source repositories while DiceFrame pins the latest stable Release to an exact commit during installation.

- Supported means the integration exists now. Partial means only the listed subset works. Reserved types cannot be installed from the store.
- Source pinned means installation resolves the latest stable GitHub Release to an exact commit and checks the plugin ID, version, and permissions again. It is not a code-safety guarantee.

The store prefers DiceFrame Hub for catalog metadata, review state, aggregate statistics, likes, ratings, and a sanitized README. If Hub is offline, DiceFrame uses its disk cache or the public registry mirrors, and local play remains available. Plugin packages are still downloaded directly from the author's repository; Hub does not proxy package bodies. Browsing the public catalog creates no installation identity. A local token is created only when an install event, like, or rating needs one. First start requires active acceptance of the Terms and acknowledgment of the Privacy Policy. Anonymous usage statistics are separate and off by default; heartbeats begin only after active opt-in and confirmation. The choice can be disabled or cleared in the final DiceFrame Hub and privacy section under Settings → Advanced. Heartbeats contain only the DiceFrame version, coarse operating system, and time bucket—not games, characters, plugin lists, model settings, logs, or game content.
- `official`, `verified`, and `community` describe source/review level, not absolute safety. Install process plugins only from trusted authors.
- A disabled Install button is accompanied by a reason. Bundled plugins update with DiceFrame; entries without a public repository or stable Release cannot be installed.
- After installation, review permissions, enter the plugin's own settings, and enable it. QQ/NapCat still needs no manually entered DiceFrame Bot Token.
- The store checks for plugin updates and notifies users; installing or updating requires manual confirmation. Process plugins only notify and require confirmation; permission or runtime expansion also requires confirmation.
- Privately shared plugins should use a `.dfplugin` file produced by the packaging script. Select it under Local Install. After manually copying a plugin directory, use Rescan Local Plugins.
- Chat presentation extensions may add commands or replace status, map, and other replies with custom text, images, or cards. If an extension fails, DiceFrame keeps using its built-in presentation; the extension cannot rewrite authoritative character state, rolls, or payment results.

## Common Chat Commands

The examples below use `@bot` for mentioning the Bot:

```text
@bot help
@bot join CharacterName
@bot create character
@bot AI character
@bot invite
@bot recap
@bot map
@bot status
@bot sense
@bot pay
@bot confirm pay
@bot reject pay
@bot I inspect the runes on the wall
@bot advance
@bot away
@bot back
```

- `join CharacterName`: bind the platform account to a Web character.
- `create character`: get character-creation instructions or an entry link.
- `AI character`: generate a character draft for confirmation.
- `invite`: send the player join link.
- `recap`: show the public recap and recent turns.
- `map`: show the current and known locations.
- `status`: show the claimed character summary.
- `sense`: request character-private information, normally by direct message.
- `pay`: view pending payments; use `confirm pay` or `reject pay` to decide.
- `advance`: let the GM or an authorized account advance.
- `away` / `back`: leave temporarily or resume participation.

## Chat Actions

Players may mention the Bot and send a natural-language action:

```text
@bot I circle behind the guard and look for the key on his belt
```

Chat and Web use the same adjudication and full-table/manual progression flow. When a check is needed, the server rolls automatically and the Bot sends a compact line such as `🎲 Character · Strength Check d20=… vs DC … → Success`, followed by GM narration and recorded state changes.

## Private Information

Some clues belong to one character, such as hidden doors, hallucinations, dreams, private thoughts, or unique perceptions. In group chat, send:

```text
@bot sense
```

The Bot attempts a direct message. If that fails, it asks the player to check temporary-session or friend settings.

## Updating DiceFrame

Check for a new version under Settings → Version Update. The apply method depends on the installation:

- Windows portable builds can download and apply an update in the WebUI. A failed candidate returns to the old version.
- Extracted source releases can apply an update and then ask for a manual restart.
- Git development checkouts should use `git pull`.
- Docker uses `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`. NAS users can also pull and recreate the image from the device's container manager.

The first move from v1.6.0 to a release with the new launcher requires one manual upgrade following that release's notes. See [Application Updates](https://github.com/diceframe/diceframe/blob/main/docs/en/updates.md) for details.

## Troubleshooting

### The AI does not respond

Check model settings and Test connection. Common causes are an incorrect API key, model name, incompatible base URL, or network failure.

### Update check returns HTTP 403

The anonymous request quota used for version checking is temporarily exhausted. Only update notifications are affected; games, saves, and model calls continue to work. Retry later or open the project's Releases page directly.

### A player cannot act

The character may be dead, not joined to the game, waiting during resolution, or viewed through GM preview. Check player status before refreshing.

### The Bot does not respond

Confirm that QQ/NapCat is enabled, then check the NapCat WebSocket host, port, and token. The group must also be bound to a game.

### Group chat does not progress

A multiplayer round may still be waiting for another active player. The GM can send `@bot 推进` or force progression in the WebUI.

### State looks wrong

Refresh the game detail. If narration conflicts with State changes, the recorded changes are authoritative. Preserve the save instead of deleting `data/` if further investigation is needed.

### Will upgrades delete custom worlds or rules?

No. Bundled templates are synchronized into `data/templates/`, while custom and AI-generated content is kept as user data. Upgrades refresh built-ins without overwriting user content. Copy the complete `data/` directory when moving computers.

If `data/config.json` or `data/secrets.json` is damaged, DiceFrame preserves it as `*.corrupt-timestamp.json` and starts with a safe empty configuration. Do not publish the preserved copy because it may contain API keys or credentials.

### Can I publish saves or chat logs?

This is not recommended. `data/` may contain API keys, access credentials, real group IDs, private messages, and complete campaign records. Never commit `data/`, `.env`, logs, or caches to a public repository.
